## About Me 🚀
I build open-source tools in **AI**, **Tokenization**, and **Bitcoin**, focusing on privacy, local-first workflows, and lightweight CLI utilities. I enjoy making projects that are powerful, decentralized, and easy to run across devices.

- 🔭 Current projects:  
  - **ai-research-hub** — collaborative AI experimentation and research pipelines  
  - **token-wallet-cli** — secure CLI wallet for managing tokens across multiple chains  
  - **btc-pay-tracker** — lightweight CLI tool to monitor Bitcoin and Lightning Network payments  
- 🌱 Learning: model version control, secure key storage, and decentralized protocols  
- 📫 Reach me: projokali@gmail.com  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m a Groot fan and like building things that “grow” in the open-source ecosystem
